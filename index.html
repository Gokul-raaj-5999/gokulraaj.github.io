							<p class="miner">(06/2023 - still)</p>
							<p>Super systems is mainly to concentrate on which algorithm this is more suitable for which kind of
								data so
								here we have like over custom classifications which this will can we used in any data set, any
								variety of
								data set,
								any range of data set and which will give an more suitable classification or regression with its
								corresponding
								algorithm which is more better to use We have develop this code as a webpage using flask and
								Python HTML and
								Jupiter notebook it is connected with
								the mongo DB and it is also connect posted in our local host it starts with step_1: user
								registration
								Step_2:
								data set uploading Step_3: algorithm calculation Step_4: will give you view the result. in which
								we had some
								amount of algorithms that are implemented as of now show it gives the algorithms efficiency.</p>
							<center><img src="images/supersystems_img1.png" width="100%"></center>
							<p>If a column has a categorical data it performs binary classification or a multiclass
								classification on its
								own if a column has a numeric data type that performs a linear regression and then gives its
								efficiency as
								well
								depending upon which algorithm you need to use it is up to you can pick, It works with an very
								good
								efficiency about maybe high appeal efficiency about 98 percentage</p>

							<h5 class="miner">2. fraud job postings - without predefined ML models</h5>
							<p class="miner">(07/2023 - 07/2023)</p>
							<p>Predict which job profile is real or fake. Here we haven't used any predefined ML models
								rather
								we have created our own model similar to custom weighted model.
								This will be creating a knowledge about how ML works at the backend. First, we will visualize
								the
								insights from the
								fake and real jobs postings and then will use custom weight based on there word count by total
								word
								count
								and predict the real and fake job postings. Finally , we will evaluate the performance of our
								classifier using several evaluation matrix.
								<center><img src="images/jobpreduction_img1.png" width="50%"></center>
								As per confusion matrix for type 1 error so that is neglect table we got 35 and for type 2 error
								we
								got 92 which
								is higher, With an efficiency of 85% and with an F1 score of 0.82

								<p>LoanTap is an online platform committed to delivering customized loan products to millennials. 
									They innovate in an otherwise dull loan segment, to deliver instant, flexible loans on consumer 
									friendly terms to salaried professionals and businessmen. 
									This case study will focus on the underwriting process behind Personal Loan only</p><br>

									from this we can see that the pression towords 1 is very good and 0 is good
									and recall towards 1 is very good and 0 is average
									f1 score towards 1 is very good and 0 is good.
									this is because of we have a unequal balance of data.
									we can have tried all the encoding that has to be and picked the most effective one as for this analysis for
									catagorical data we are good with target encoding. may be we should have done this to all catagorical columns.
									the data is biased towrods the one catagory so that we can perform the SMOTE analysis to make it normal and
									unbiased.
									and can used VIF technique to make the high correlated columns and to remove multi collinearity.

								<p>Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it GMAT, GRE or SAT,
									their unique problem-solving methods ensure maximum scores with minimum effort.They recently launched a
									feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the
									IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.</p>
								<center><img src="images/jamboreeEdu_img1.png" width="50%"></center>
								<p>
									So we splitted our data into 3 parts train, validate and test. train and test of 20% split and that even 20% split
									is further divided into 25% and 25%. so we trained our data and then if we validate
									it with X_val we order efficiency of 83%. so we predicted the values with exit test and white
									test which comes to be an MSE is 0.008 so we finally found a data frame of chance of admit and predicted
									chance of admit which is really quite interesting that most of the increasing lines are overlapping as you can
									see in this figure last figure our model is more efficient on chance of admit that lies in the range of 0.4 till
									0.9 so most of the Rangers like there and below 0.4 or 0.3 it is not even detecting so which means very low chance
									of admit is it is not detecting properly maybe we can increase the data even more.
