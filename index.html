					</div>
					<div class="detailslisting" id="details1">
						<p>Super systems is mainly to concentrate on which algorithm this is more suitable for which
							kind of
							data so
							here we have like over custom classifications which this will can we used in any data set,
							any
							variety of
							data set,
							any range of data set and which will give an more suitable classification or regression with
							its
							corresponding
							algorithm which is more better to use We have develop this code as a webpage using flask and
							Python HTML and
							Jupiter notebook it is connected with
							the mongo DB and it is also connect posted in our local host it starts with step_1: user
							registration
							Step_2:
							data set uploading Step_3: algorithm calculation Step_4: will give you view the result. in
							which
							we had some
							amount of algorithms that are implemented as of now show it gives the algorithms efficiency.
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/supersystems_img1.png" width="100%"></center>
						<p>If a column has a categorical data it performs binary classification or a multiclass
							classification on its
							own if a column has a numeric data type that performs a linear regression and then gives its
							efficiency as
							well
							depending upon which algorithm you need to use it is up to you can pick, It works with an
							very
							good
							efficiency about maybe high appeal efficiency about 98 percentage</p>

					<div class="detailslisting" id="details2">
						<p>Predict which job profile is real or fake. Here we haven't used any predefined ML models
							rather
							we have created our own model similar to custom weighted model.
							This will be creating a knowledge about how ML works at the backend. First, we will
							visualize
							the
							insights from the
							fake and real jobs postings and then will use custom weight based on there word count by
							total
							word
							count
							and predict the real and fake job postings. Finally , we will evaluate the performance of
							our
							classifier using several evaluation matrix.
							<center><img src="images/jobpreduction_img1.png" width="50%"></center>
							As per confusion matrix for type 1 error so that is neglect table we got 35 and for type 2
							error

							is higher, With an efficiency of 85% and with an F1 score of 0.82

						<p>Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it

							Indian perspective.</p>
						<center><img src="images/jamboreeEdu_img1.png" width="50%"></center>
						<p>
							So we splitted our data into 3 parts train, validate and test. train and test of 20%
							split and that even 20% split
							is further divided into 25% and 25%. so we trained our data and then if we validate
							it with X_val we order efficiency of 83%. so we predicted the values with exit test and
							white
							test which comes to be an MSE is 0.008 so we finally found a data frame of chance of
							admit and predicted
							chance of admit which is really quite interesting that most of the increasing lines are
							overlapping as you can
							see in this figure last figure our model is more efficient on chance of admit that lies
							in the range of 0.4 till
							0.9 so most of the Rangers like there and below 0.4 or 0.3 it is not even detecting so
							which means very low chance
							of admit is it is not detecting properly maybe we can increase the data even more.

							Customer retention decreases over years in the same city, suggesting regular discounts could
							help. Product category 1 sells well, requiring less advertising; others may benefit from
							more promotion. Gender spending patterns overlap significantly, warranting common discounts
							for both. No significant difference found between married and unmarried customers; common
							offers suffice. Confidence intervals overlap in age bins, suggesting no need for separate
							discounts. No distinct age group stands out in spending; common discounts across age groups
							are advised. Skewed data towards mean implies stability; common discounts can be effective.
							Overall, common discount strategies are recommended based on shared patterns and overlaps.

							Data analysis reveals trends in delivery patterns for the year 2018, particularly in
							September and October, although caution is advised due to the relatively small dataset size.
							Missing values in source and destination centers were identified and dropped, with attempts
							made to reconcile using existing data but proved inconclusive. Columns with undefined
							properties were dropped for code clarity and reusability. Data normalization was conducted
							to standardize courier routes and analyze trip segments efficiently. Analysis of destination
							centers revealed concentration in specific states, suggesting targeted infrastructure
							improvements for efficiency. Similar operations were conducted for source states, indicating
							potential optimization opportunities. Trip creation times exhibited patterns, suggesting
							targeted order placement times for efficiency. Analysis of scan times indicated efficient

							Further comparisons between actual and estimated
							delivery times highlighted areas for potential optimization. Outlier treatment revealed
							differences in mean delivery times, suggesting segmentation improves efficiency. Analysis of
							distances showed optimization in route planning, reducing overall travel distance.
							Chi-square analysis revealed independence among source and destination variables, limiting
							predictive inference. ANOVA analysis indicated variations in mean distances between
							different delivery routes. High trip creation rates in specific states point to areas of
							high delivery demand. Overall, data-driven recommendations focus on optimizing delivery
							processes and infrastructure to enhance efficiency and meet demand effectively.
